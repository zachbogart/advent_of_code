In this one we must help the crabs save us from a giant whale. Let's go...

## Setup

```{r}
# raw data
input <- read_lines(path_data)

# make into a vector
data <- input %>% 
  str_split(pattern = ",")
data <- as.numeric(data[[1]])

# test input
testing <- c(16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14)

# dfs
test <- tibble(raw = testing)
df <- tibble(raw = data)
```

## Part 1

The crabs need a position that minimizes the distance they collectively have to travel. So the median of the distribution.

```{r}
# every step is equal, so choose the median
part_1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(fuel_spent = abs(raw - median(raw)))

# result
part_1 %>% 
  summarise(total_fuel = sum(fuel_spent))
```

## Part 2

I would actually want a good explainer on why flooring is necessary rather than rounding. Never adds extra steps? Anywho, we can be fancy about finding the fuel spent thanks to [Gauss and his wiliness in school](https://nrich.maths.org/2478#:~:text=The%20most%20well%2Dknown%20story,wrote%20down%20the%20answer%205050.).

```{r}

# find the steps from the floored mean
# then find spent fuel (thanks Gauss)
part_2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(steps = abs(raw - floor(mean(raw)))) %>% 
  mutate(fuel_spent = (steps * (steps + 1) / 2))
  
# result
part_2 %>% 
  summarise(total_fuel = sum(fuel_spent))
```

## All Done!

And the crabs have saved the day! Hope you learned something!

How would you do it? What's your shortcut? Please [share](https://twitter.com/zachbogart)!

Till next time!
