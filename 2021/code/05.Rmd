We're drawing lines underwater to dodge some underwater dangers. Let's go...

## Setup

Before we can count the overlaps, we need to make the data all friendly. We can do a bunch of separations to split up the lines, finally getting a dataframe where each row is one line, start point and end point.

```{r}
# just keep splitting, just keep splitting...
points <- input %>% 
  separate(x, into = c("p1", "p2"), sep = " -> ") %>% 
  separate(p1, into = c("x1", "y1"), sep = ",") %>% 
  separate(p2, into = c("x2", "y2"), sep = ",") %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.numeric))

points
```

## Part 1

For the first part, we only care about horizontal and vertical lines. So we can:

- tackle each line type separately
- filter out for specific line
- In each case, one of the dimensions can be reduced to a single value, while the other has a min and max value
- We can then find the difference between the two extremes

```{r}
# only consider horizontal and vertical lines

lines_v <- points %>% 
  # filter and clean
  filter(x1 == x2) %>% 
  select(-x2) %>% 
  rename(x = x1) %>% 
  # by row, find extremes
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(ymin = min(y1,y2),
         ymax = max(y1,y2)) %>% 
  # you've done your job
  select(-c(y1, y2)) %>% 
  # find diff for interim points
  mutate(diff = ymax - ymin + 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # label each line
  mutate(line = row_number(), .before = x)

# same for horizontal, but swap a bunch of X's and Y's
lines_h <- points %>% 
  filter(y1 == y2) %>% 
  select(-y2) %>% 
  rename(y = y1) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(xmin = min(x1,x2),
         xmax = max(x1,x2)) %>% 
  select(-c(x1, x2)) %>% 
  mutate(diff = xmax - xmin + 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(line = row_number(), .before = y)

# example of horizontal lines
lines_h
```

Now we want to expand each line, making a dataframe that adds in all of the interim points. We can use `uncount`, which is awesome!

- repeat the rows with uncount by the `diff`
- for each line, find the increment for interim points
- create the interim points and tidy up

```{r}
# make the lines into sets of points

vert_line_points <- lines_v %>% 
  # uncount, super awesome!
  uncount(diff) %>% 
  # for each line, create increment
  group_by(line) %>% 
  mutate(increment = row_number() - 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # create the interim points
  mutate(y = ymin + increment) %>% 
  # tidy up
  mutate(type = "vertical") %>% 
  select(type, line, x, y)

# same for horizontal
horiz_line_points <- lines_h %>% 
  uncount(diff) %>% 
  group_by(line) %>% 
  mutate(increment = row_number() - 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(x = xmin + increment) %>% 
  mutate(type = "horizontal") %>% 
  select(type, line, x, y)

# example of all vertical points
vert_line_points
```

Now we can find all of the overlaps! We can combine the two dataframes of points and look for x/y pairs that repeat. If any repeat two or more times, we count them.

```{r}
# combine points
all_points <- bind_rows(horiz_line_points, vert_line_points)

# find large overlaps
overlaps_p1 <- all_points %>% 
  count(x,y, sort = TRUE, name = "overlaps") %>% 
  filter(overlaps >= 2)

overlaps_p1
```

We see we have `r dim(overlaps_p1)[1]` rows. But now we need to include diagonals...

## Part 2

Note to myself late at night:

> Add in the diagonals. Need to take the slope into account when creating interim points. Have everything setup. Too tired, will try tomorrow when I'm more well rested. Zzz...

Tried to do this late at night, but was too tired to think straight. Was much clearer in the morning and I had everything mise en place for myself!

For the diagonal lines, we need to alter our method a bit to deal with each type of diagonal. We can make the dataframe of lines like before, but we will add in a slope term to distinguish each diagonal type.

```{r}
lines_d <- points %>% 
  # the one's that aren't horizontal
  filter(!(x1 == x2 | y1 == y2)) %>% 
  # by row, find extremes and interim differences
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(xmin = min(x1,x2),
         xmax = max(x1,x2),
         ymin = min(y1,y2),
         ymax = max(y1,y2)) %>% 
  mutate(diff = xmax - xmin + 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # label lines
  mutate(line = row_number(), .before = x1) %>% 
  # add in the slope for orientation
  mutate(slope = (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)) %>% 
  # you've done your job
  select(-c(x1, x2, y1, y2))

lines_d
```

Now when we add in the interim points, we just need to check the slope. From our perspective, the y value is always increasing, so we can add the increment like above. For the x value, we just check the slope and either start at the min value and add or the max value and subtract. And since the diagonals are always 45 degrees, we can increment/decrement by one each time. Tada!

```{r}
# same as above, but check diagonal
diag_line_points <- lines_d %>% 
  uncount(diff) %>% 
  group_by(line) %>% 
  mutate(increment = row_number() - 1) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(y = ymin + increment) %>% 
  # left or right diagonal
  mutate(x = ifelse(
    slope > 0,
    xmin + increment,
    xmax - increment
  )) %>% 
  # tidy up
  mutate(type = "diagonal") %>% 
  select(type, line, x, y)

diag_line_points
```

And then tack on the diagonals and check for large overlaps:

```{r}
# with diagonals
all_points2 <- bind_rows(
  horiz_line_points, 
  vert_line_points,
  diag_line_points
)

# overlaps with diagonals
overlaps_p2 <- all_points2 %>% 
  count(x,y, sort = TRUE, name = "overlaps") %>% 
  filter(overlaps >= 2)

overlaps_p2
```

We see we have `r dim(overlaps_p2)[1]` rows.

## All Done!

And there we go! All overlaps accounted for. Hope you learned something!
